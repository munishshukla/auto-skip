## Hey there,

Are you annoyed by sudden youtube ads?

Guess what? Automates the process of clicking the "Skip Ad" button with Auto Skip Chrome Extension. 

it's not an ad blocker, it simply automates the process of clicking on the "Skip Ad" button on Youtube.

it's really handy when you are going through some playlist or chilling and watching your favorite YouTuber, no need to bother and click on "Skip Ad" button, simply sit back and enjoy the content without any interruption.

Hoping, this extension is making your YouTube experience better.

> Happy Coding!

> Happy youtubing!
